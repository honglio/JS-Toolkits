# Common JS

This is my repo for reuse and common solutions that I have completed 
prior to or during an interview, as well as general problem snippets. 
I hope that all these problems (and solutions) are useful to others 
for practice and review. 

## Problems

### Data Structures

* [Stack]
* [Queue] 
* [Linked List] 
* [Multimap]

### DOM-based Solutions

* [Widget] * Not implement yet

### Word Solutions

* [Word Positions]
* [Word analytics]

## Testing

```sh
npm install # Installs `mocha` and any other dependencies needed to run
npm test    # Runs the testing scripts
```

Feel free to contribute any solutions and optimisation.
